# wmh - white matter hyperintensity - supervisory segmentation

## Overview
This project aims to develop a supervisory model for a segmentation network using multiple instance learning. By labeling patches based on their corresponding original masks it is possible to train a model the classification task which then can be used to generate attention maps | attribution maps, subsequently enabling to create binary masks indicating WHM features. Afterwards, model may overwatch segmentation network for improved results.
